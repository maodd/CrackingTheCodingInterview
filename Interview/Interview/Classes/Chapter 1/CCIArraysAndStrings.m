 Note: There are some strings which are indistinguishable from other strings un/compressed formats. E.g. a1b1c1 cannot be compressed and would equal a1b1c1, but when looking at a1b1c1, how do you know that you're looking at an uncompressed string? It's certainly possible that this is merely abc compressed.

 increase i, work out the rest after, but so far we should have:
 row = 0, col = 1
 left = 0, right = 1
 m = right+1 or n-1, = 0-indexed width/height of matrix
 7 2 1  (0,1) = temp,       (1,0)=>(0,1),      (2,1)=>(1,0),    (1,1)=>(2,1),   (temp)=>(1,1)
 4 5 6  (row,col) = temp    (m-col,row)=> <--  (m, m-col)=> <-- (col, m)=> <--  (temp)=> <--
 9 8 3

 Note: some information is missing from these comments for how I solved, but it became the most obvious when I moved to a 6x6 matrix
 I solved 1x1, 2x2, 3x3 matrixes on my first iteration, but as soon as it had work to do when moving inward I found my solution wasn't
 correct. Because the inner 2x2 matrix has row/cols of 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 2/2, I found it more difficult to debug than when I was dealing with say,
 the 6x6 where on the second step it will be, =>r1c1=>r1c4=>r4c4=>r1c4 then move to r1c2=>r2c4=>r4c3=>r3c1
